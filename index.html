    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Football, known as soccer in some countries, is the world’s most popular sport — played and watched by billions of people across every continent. The game is centered around teamwork, skill, and strategy, uniting players and fans under a single goal: to outscore the opponent by getting the ball into the opposing team’s net.
      <br><br>
      A standard match is played between two teams of eleven players, including one goalkeeper on each side. The game is governed by 17 Laws of the Game, maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) and overseen globally by FIFA.
      <br><br>
      Matches take place on a rectangular grass or turf field, with goals at each end. It consists of two 45-minute halves, plus extra time if needed. Except for goalkeepers within their penalty area, players cannot use their hands or arms.
      <br><br>
      Football is celebrated for its creativity, rhythm, and unpredictability. Legendary tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, and Copa América showcase the best talents in the sport. From casual street games to massive stadium events, football unites cultures and defines passion.
